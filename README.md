**CHALLENGE**

**CYPTOCURRENCIES**

Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, they&#39;ve asked to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, we decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm. We&#39;ll use data visualizations to share our findings with the board.

- Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

**RESULTS:**

- The K-Means comes out to be 4 using Elbow Curve
